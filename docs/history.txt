- Major upgrade to PAWS capabilities in this commit.  Most of this functionality
  was already here but unused or not working right.  Here is an explanation of
  what is possible, with pointers to examples:
    1. Anywhere an image is needed, you can now use a tilable stretchable image.
       This images can be made with 3 components to stretch horizontally, 3
       components to stretch vertically, or 9 components to stretch both directions.
       See the new imagelist.xml in default.zip for examples of these.
    2. PAWS styles now work much better.  In any <widget> tag you can specify
       style="whatever" and the xml for that style in /data/gui/styles.xml will
       be dropped into that widget.  This means anything can be overridden with
       styles.  Backgrounds, fonts, and the next feature.
    3. New widget subtag, <defaultstyle>.  This allows you to specify for a
       widget that any widget with the named factory should get the named style
       unless overridden locally.  For example:

          <defaultstyle factory="pawsButton" style="redbutton"/>

       If this is specified at a parent level, then all buttons in this widget
       will use the redbutton class without having to specify it each time.

       If this is specified inside a style, then any widget getting this style
       will use the "redbutton" style for any of this widget's buttons.

       By specifying defaultstyle's for many factories in a standard style,
       we should be able to pull out nearly ALL style information from the 
       widget definitions and only store them in 1 place.

  displayed.

- Also committed a fix by Nick Prassas (Loyni) for bug 2691.  Thanks Nick!
  (Net Version bump)

*** 2009-01-15 by Kenny Graunke
- Implemented targeting by ItemID(*) for admin commands, i.e.
  "/teleport itemid:407 here".  This will be immensely useful when working
  with container ALs, as they only specify ItemID, not EID.
  
  (*) "ItemID" means psItem/item_instance UID, not item_stats.  If you find
      any incorrect uses, please rename them to "ItemStatsID" for clarity.

*** 2009-01-14 by Stefano Angeleri
- Comment fixes by kougaro
- Made npc rotate back to their original position after talking with
  them patch by kougaro
- fixed /inspect being cut by the packet size limit
- /deputize now allows devs to set up to their level differently than
  gm who keep the <their level - 1> rule

*** 2009-01-13 by Stefano Angeleri
- Changed tabs to spaces and trimmed ending spaces
- Added the possibility to load/save descriptions from file.
  They are stored in /description/char_name_description.txt and ca be
  easily loaded with a button from the char description editing window
  fixing PS#2434 - Loading-/Saving-functions for player descriptions 
- Committed patch by Electricsheep fixing
  PS#2632 - resizing the chardescription edit window. with some
  refactoring from me
- Updates to the compiling guide
- Added OOC tab help by doshot

*** 2009-01-10 by Keith Fulton
- Now PaladinJr will not report teleports or shifts as cheat moves.
- Restructured the allowed lag calculations significantly.  Khaki if you're out there
  your review would be appreciated.
- Left in the debug printf spam intentionally to help the testing team help me figure
  out where the remaining problems are.
- Final functor messaging conversion is completed.
- Renamed psWorkManager to WorkManager for consistency.  I think all the "ps" prefixes
  are now gone from the Manager level anyway.

*** 2009-01-10 by Stefano Angeleri
- Ignoring quest prereqs when questtester is set
- Made an error message in crafting more visible

*** 2009-01-07 by Steven Patrick
- Fixed FS#2458 : Make NPCs face player when talking, patch by kougaro.

*** 2009-01-07 by Dave Bentham
- Improved some GUI texts for minigames to distnguish between games
  and puzzles.

*** 2009-01-07 by Stefano Angeleri
- Fixed NPC camera collision detection it was skipping the code acting
  always as with collision detection disabled

*** 2009-01-06 by Keith Fulton
- Changed sector specifier in npc_spawn_ranges table to be a FK directly
  to the sectors table instead of a common string with the name of the sector
  in the string.  This is a tighter structure for this table.
  DB VERSION BUMP.
- On a side note, Aiken has tested this functionality and it does work.
  We should use it.
- Fixed crash if the speex plugin isn't available, which has the effect of the 
  file being found but the data still unable to be loaded (crashes the client).
- Fixed crash in npc /give check for frozen targetClient
- Now quests break up dialog into different say commands, one sentence at a time.
  The objective of this is to make the chat (and chat bubbles) more readable and
  give better pacing with the eventual audio files.

*** 2009-01-06 by Dave Bentham
- Progression scripts can be kicked by mini-games when won, by adding
  script='prog_script_name' to the action_location. In script terms, the
  winner = actor, loser = target.

*** 2009-01-06 by Stefano Angeleri
- Fixed FS#1548 - Battle Helms can be equipped in hands.
  The code replaced $H (which is used only for replacements for helms
  and most probably was intended so) only in case the helm was in the
  helm slot making it impossible to get the right mesh if you hold
  it in the hands for example. Also removed the definition of a psstring
  to use replaceallsubstring as the replaceall in crystal space csstring
  does already what's needed avoiding useless assignments and conversions

*** 2009-01-05 by Keith Fulton
- Now Paladin detects speed hacks and kicks you off the server if you run too quickly
  for more than a few seconds.  Needs to be tested more by the Testing team if
  possible for false positives mostly.
- New fixed version doesn't hardcode max speed to always be 1.  :)


*** 2009-01-04 by Stefano Angeleri
- Changed cordinates of the hide/show button in order to make it not

*** 2009-01-03 by Stefano Angeleri
- Lowered access level of /killnpc to gm2
- Added /assignfaction [target] [factioname] value for gm4+
  It allows to assign relative factions to targets
- Additional safety checks in drop by kougaro

- Fixed bug FS#2498: invisible GMs can register in events now.
