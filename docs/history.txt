- Added sending of instance in the all entity message to the npc client and
  actor perseption message.
  => NPC NET VERSION BUMPED!
  => NET VERSION BUMPED!
- Improved server command setlog <log> <flag> <filter> to match
  any unique substrings for the log argument. So now
  "setlog mes true" will enable log for LOG_MESSAGES.

*** 2008-01-17 by Anders Reggestad
- Fixed setting of charges when exchanging items.
- Save item when charges are changed.

*** 2008-01-16 by Sasha Levin
- Removed pointless calculation from pscamera.
- Another fix for FS#907 - Trying to consume as many items as possible
  instead of failing.

*** 2008-01-16 by Anders Reggestad
- Added charges to the item_instances and max_charges to the item_stats
  table. 
    => DB VERSION BUMPED!
  Added progression script operation <charge charges="#">script</charge>
  that will only run once for the item in question. To do this the
  progression manager where extended to now work on the actor, target, and an item.
  Item is given to the progression operations for equip and unequip and for attacks,
  so that should make it possible to create some interessting combinations. 
  This fixed BT#1271. Items now have the possibility for charges so the
  summon familiare script could be updated to use the new function
  to set number of charges to 1 for the ring of familiar and than
  only charge/run one time.

*** 2008-01-14 by Roland Schulz
- fix part of FS#778. Labels weren't updated in mouseover mode.

  path already in db.

  locate "waypoint:group:plaza" to locate an waypoint in

  location type did give, but when used on waypoints the 
  waypoint will be defined in the path network so less
  chanse of collision when using wander.
  => DB VERSION BUMPED!
- Changed formating of /path info output.
- Changed locate operation to have :name and :group subfunction 
  when locating waypoints. Updated npcbehave.xml to reflect this.

- Work on FS#928:
  - Fixed bug where min transparency was set equal to max by default.
  - Made default max transparency 50% instead of 78% in most windows; fixed
    some windows which had 0% max transparency by default.

  art looks better at the right ratio, but extra height can be very useful.

  content depending on sent to or from client. Added new
  PERSIST_WORLD_REQUEST message id.

  direct CEL calls.
