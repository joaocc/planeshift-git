- Improved some GUI texts for minigames to distnguish between games
  and puzzles.

- Fixed NPC camera collision detection it was skipping the code acting
  always as with collision detection disabled

- Changed sector specifier in npc_spawn_ranges table to be a FK directly
  to the sectors table instead of a common string with the name of the sector
  in the string.  This is a tighter structure for this table.
  DB VERSION BUMP.
- On a side note, Aiken has tested this functionality and it does work.
  We should use it.
- Fixed crash if the speex plugin isn't available, which has the effect of the 
  file being found but the data still unable to be loaded (crashes the client).
- Fixed crash in npc /give check for frozen targetClient
- Now quests break up dialog into different say commands, one sentence at a time.
  The objective of this is to make the chat (and chat bubbles) more readable and
  give better pacing with the eventual audio files.

- Progression scripts can be kicked by mini-games when won, by adding
  script='prog_script_name' to the action_location. In script terms, the
  winner = actor, loser = target.

- Fixed FS#1548 - Battle Helms can be equipped in hands.
  The code replaced $H (which is used only for replacements for helms
  and most probably was intended so) only in case the helm was in the
  helm slot making it impossible to get the right mesh if you hold
  it in the hands for example. Also removed the definition of a psstring
  to use replaceallsubstring as the replaceall in crystal space csstring
  does already what's needed avoiding useless assignments and conversions

- Now Paladin detects speed hacks and kicks you off the server if you run too quickly
  for more than a few seconds.  Needs to be tested more by the Testing team if
  possible for false positives mostly.
- New fixed version doesn't hardcode max speed to always be 1.  :)


*** 2009-01-04 by Stefano Angeleri
- Changed cordinates of the hide/show button in order to make it not
  move around when clicked (except style 2)
- Disabled Style change if the toolbar is hidden
- Added some descriptive tooltip on the hide/show button
- Fix for FS#673 - trias in skills panel not updated patch by kougaro

*** 2009-01-03 by Stefano Angeleri
- Lowered access level of /killnpc to gm2
- Added /assignfaction [target] [factioname] value for gm4+
  It allows to assign relative factions to targets
- Additional safety checks in drop by kougaro

*** 2009-01-02 by Dave Bentham
- Fixed bug FS#2498: invisible GMs can register in events now.
