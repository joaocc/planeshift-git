- Implemented the riddle prompt functionality from the quest popup menus.
  Use:  Menu: ?=Question Reminder to script this functionality.
  Talk to the Merchant to get this puzzle quest and try it.  "blue" is the correct
  answer to the riddle.  It is quest script 210 if you want to see the example.

*** 2009-02-24 by Stefano Angeleri
- Updated gm gui to the new paws specifications
- Fixed PS#2785 - [pawscrollbar] Keeps scrolling undefinitely even when
  not clicking. pawsscrollbar onbuttonrelease() was forgot with the
  old definition and so it wasn't called anymore making scroll not work
  correctly while clicking on arrows.

*** 2009-02-18 by Keith Fulton
- PAWS update
   1. Now syntax of <pawsButton bla.bla></pawsButton> is supported instead
      of cumbersome <widget factory="pawsButton" bla bla></widget> syntax.
   2. styles now work and support repeated tags.
   3. image definitions can now be horizontal or vertial "3-patches" where the
      middle part automatically tiles.  They can also be rectangular "9-patches"
      where the middle parts of the edges repeat on the edges and the middle part
      tiles in the middle to accommodate any widget size.  These can be used
      interchangeably wherever single images used to be used.
   4. CTRL-ALT-Click on the Close Box of a window now reloads that window xml file.
      This is not guaranteed not to crash the client but a lot better than exiting
      and reloading every time you tweak a widget position 1 pixel.
   5. Also changed the default button behavior to use OnButtonReleased, not OnButtonPressed.
      This equates to processing the button on mouse up, not mouse down, which is
      the way every GUI in the world works.  We need to change all windows to do
      this correctly.
   6. A number of windows have been redone to support the above.
- Miscellaneous fixes discovered during the above.
- Restyled Help Window and Spell Window

*** 2009-02-18 by Tristan Cragnolini
- Patch for PS#2744 by Loyni - ambient sound and voices options now
  treated separately, plus a fix to sound after the window lost focus.

  in invalid slots.

*** 2009-02-15 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added a knownspell quest prerequisite operator
  eg: <knownspell spell="Darkness" />
  where spell is the name of the spell we are looking for
- Removed a non working and deprecated /confirmgroupjoin, fixes to
  /guildinfo and to the bugreport command patch by loyni

*** 2009-02-14 by Stefano Angeleri
- Changed the marriage quest prerequisite operator to be easier
  now it's just <married /> which will be true if the character is
  married and false if he isn't. To get the the inverse value as true
  (you want a not married character) just do <not><married /></not>

*** 2009-02-13 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added a marriage quest prerequisite operator
  eg: <marriage status="yes">
  status can be either yes or no. yes will return true if the character
  is married else false. no will return true if the character isn't
  married else false

  both = It means min and max will be taken in consideration
  min = It means min will be taken in consideration
  max = It means max will be taken in consideration

  morning/afternoon/evening/night depending on the hour patch by Lanarel

﻿*** 2009-02-06 by Stefano Angeleri
- Added guild quest prerequisites eg: <guild type="public"/>

*** 2009-02-05 by Stefano Angeleri
- Various fixes and clean ups by kougaro
- Completed work on the new descriptions
- Fixed an issue which would stop the player from editing his custom
  life events if there was nothing in the tab
- Added the possibility to add little scripts which will define dynamically
  generated life events based on the character faction points. The script
  must be ordered from the absolute highest value to the lowest one. The
  fact a number is negative doesn't matter so: 20 10 is correct, 20 -20
  10 -10 is correct, 10 -20 is correct but 10 20 -10 -20 and 20 10 -10 -20
  are wrong.
- Added some sample data to faction.sql to demonstrate the dynamic life
  events function, part of it was provided by Xillix
- Some commenting improvements
- Tab/spaces fixes
- Added race and gender quest prerequisites for race it's
  <race name="Klyros"/> for gender it's <gender type="M"/>

- Changed hardcoded PI values to the Crystal Space provided PI define
- Added a faction_character column in the faction table which should store
  how the dinamyc faction should be applied in the life events of a character
- added a life_description column in character which holds the editable
  part of the char creation/life events tab in the character description

*** 2009-01-19 by Keith Fulton
- Major upgrade to PAWS capabilities in this commit.  Most of this functionality
  was already here but unused or not working right.  Here is an explanation of
  what is possible, with pointers to examples:
    1. Anywhere an image is needed, you can now use a tilable stretchable image.
       This images can be made with 3 components to stretch horizontally, 3
       components to stretch vertically, or 9 components to stretch both directions.
       See the new imagelist.xml in default.zip for examples of these.
    2. PAWS styles now work much better.  In any <widget> tag you can specify
       style="whatever" and the xml for that style in /data/gui/styles.xml will
       be dropped into that widget.  This means anything can be overridden with
       styles.  Backgrounds, fonts, and the next feature.
    3. New widget subtag, <defaultstyle>.  This allows you to specify for a
       widget that any widget with the named factory should get the named style
       unless overridden locally.  For example:

          <defaultstyle factory="pawsButton" style="redbutton"/>

       If this is specified at a parent level, then all buttons in this widget
       will use the redbutton class without having to specify it each time.

       If this is specified inside a style, then any widget getting this style
       will use the "redbutton" style for any of this widget's buttons.

       By specifying defaultstyle's for many factories in a standard style,
       we should be able to pull out nearly ALL style information from the 
       widget definitions and only store them in 1 place.

  (Net Version bump)

*** 2009-01-15 by Kenny Graunke
- Implemented targeting by ItemID(*) for admin commands, i.e.
  "/teleport itemid:407 here".  This will be immensely useful when working
  with container ALs, as they only specify ItemID, not EID.
  
  (*) "ItemID" means psItem/item_instance UID, not item_stats.  If you find
      any incorrect uses, please rename them to "ItemStatsID" for clarity.

*** 2009-01-14 by Stefano Angeleri
- Comment fixes by kougaro
- Made npc rotate back to their original position after talking with
  them patch by kougaro
- fixed /inspect being cut by the packet size limit

- Committed patch by Electricsheep fixing
  PS#2632 - resizing the chardescription edit window. with some
  refactoring from me
- Updates to the compiling guide
- Added OOC tab help by doshot

*** 2009-01-10 by Keith Fulton
- Now PaladinJr will not report teleports or shifts as cheat moves.
- Restructured the allowed lag calculations significantly.  Khaki if you're out there
  your review would be appreciated.
- Left in the debug printf spam intentionally to help the testing team help me figure
  out where the remaining problems are.
- Final functor messaging conversion is completed.
- Renamed psWorkManager to WorkManager for consistency.  I think all the "ps" prefixes
  are now gone from the Manager level anyway.

*** 2009-01-10 by Stefano Angeleri
- Ignoring quest prereqs when questtester is set
- Made an error message in crafting more visible

*** 2009-01-07 by Steven Patrick
- Fixed FS#2458 : Make NPCs face player when talking, patch by kougaro.

*** 2009-01-07 by Dave Bentham
- Improved some GUI texts for minigames to distnguish between games
  and puzzles.

*** 2009-01-07 by Stefano Angeleri
- Fixed NPC camera collision detection it was skipping the code acting
  always as with collision detection disabled

*** 2009-01-06 by Keith Fulton
- Changed sector specifier in npc_spawn_ranges table to be a FK directly
  to the sectors table instead of a common string with the name of the sector
  in the string.  This is a tighter structure for this table.
  DB VERSION BUMP.
- On a side note, Aiken has tested this functionality and it does work.
  We should use it.
- Fixed crash if the speex plugin isn't available, which has the effect of the 
  file being found but the data still unable to be loaded (crashes the client).
- Fixed crash in npc /give check for frozen targetClient
- Now quests break up dialog into different say commands, one sentence at a time.
  The objective of this is to make the chat (and chat bubbles) more readable and
  give better pacing with the eventual audio files.

*** 2009-01-06 by Dave Bentham
- Progression scripts can be kicked by mini-games when won, by adding
  script='prog_script_name' to the action_location. In script terms, the
  winner = actor, loser = target.

*** 2009-01-06 by Stefano Angeleri
- Fixed FS#1548 - Battle Helms can be equipped in hands.
  The code replaced $H (which is used only for replacements for helms
  and most probably was intended so) only in case the helm was in the
  helm slot making it impossible to get the right mesh if you hold
  it in the hands for example. Also removed the definition of a psstring
  to use replaceallsubstring as the replaceall in crystal space csstring
  does already what's needed avoiding useless assignments and conversions

*** 2009-01-05 by Keith Fulton
- Now Paladin detects speed hacks and kicks you off the server if you run too quickly
  for more than a few seconds.  Needs to be tested more by the Testing team if
  possible for false positives mostly.
- New fixed version doesn't hardcode max speed to always be 1.  :)


*** 2009-01-04 by Stefano Angeleri
